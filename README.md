# RPP

## Overview

The purpose of this program is the calculation of the optimal path (in terms of distance traveled) and the safest path,
between two specified points in a convex environment with convex or line obstacles . 

The robot can be one of the three following types : disk,line or rectangular.

The paths can be calculated for two types of motion: 

* Pure translational motion : The robot retains a constant orientation in its movement.

* Combined rotational and translational motion : The robot can change its orientation while moving.

(For disk robots , pure translational and combined motions are identical).
